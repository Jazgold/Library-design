        <h3>Twice as Hard: The Stories of Black Women Who Fought to 
         Become Physicians,<br> from the Civil War to the 21st Century <div class="color">By <a href="">Jasmine Brown</a> (Author)</div> <div class="pub">Published by Beacon Press</div> 
          <div class="date"> Jan 24, 2023 | 240 Pages | 6 x 9 | ISBN 9780807025086</div> <div class="bold"><b>Black women physicians’ stories have gone untold for far too long, leaving gaping holes in American
            medical history, in women’s history, and in black history. It’s time to set the record straight. </b> <br><br> No real account of black women physicians in the US exists, and what little
            mention is made of these women in existing histories is often insubstantial or
            altogether incorrect. In this work of extensive research, Jasmine Brown offers a
            rich new perspective, penning the long-erased stories of nine pioneering black
            women physicians beginning in 1860, when a black woman first entered
            medical school. Brown champions these black women physicians, including 
            stories of: <br> <b>Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler,</b> who graduated from medical school only fourteen
            months after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed and provided medical
            care for the newly freed slaves who had been neglected and exploited 
            by the medical system and many more.
